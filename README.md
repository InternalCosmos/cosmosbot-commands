# CosmosBot
I removed a lot of the commands for a few reasons. I removed a lot of info as well, like tokens and ids.

Have fun with this info.
I have no clue why people wanted this code. TBH I dislike my progress on this bot. I could've done so much better, but didn't. I have only myself to blame.
That's why I plan to redeem myself with my new bot Kaneki.
